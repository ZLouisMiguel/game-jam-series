##  Game Jam Series

**Game Jam Series** is a project where I learn and improve by building playable games from scratch.

This repository acts as the **main hub** for all the games in the series. Each game lives in its own repository and explores different mechanics, ideas, and tools primarily using **JavaScript and TypeScript**.

New games will be added over time as the series continues.
